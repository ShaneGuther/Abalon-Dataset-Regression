# Abalone-Dataset-Regression
Regression models applied to abalone dataset as part of a school assignment

The abalone dataset provides information about abalone, a species of marine snails.  Multiple features are provided about a large number of specific snails which can be used to predict what features new snails will have.  In this project the age of abalone is examined in detail, with the goal being to accurately predict the age of snails using regression.  Bayesian Ridge regression is used as a model to train and test the data set.  Age is determined by the number of rings plus 1.5, so this is taken into account when determining the results.
